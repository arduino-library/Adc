# Adc

This library implements an abstraction layer for the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) of the Atmega328. This library is being used in the Magnetic Loop Antenna and the Raspberry Pi UPS projects. Following are the main features:

* Cycle through a list of Analog inputs
* Perform averaging over several consecutive ADC readings

Git commands:

* git submodule add ssh://git@github.com/arduino-library/Adc src/Adc
* git submodule add https://github.com/arduino-library/Adc src/Adc
